## Dev and Prod folders for the framework patterns Udacity project.

Frontend Nanodegree project: Frameworks and AJAX

This folder contains the development and productio versions of my Neighbourhood Map Application for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree.

The site can be visited live at http://pixiespace.com/mapsite/

The page consists of a search box and a map with several themed icons. clicking the listed locations or the markers will cause an Infowindow to appear containing recent flickr photographs from that area and a list of nearby locations of a specific type, taken from FourSQuare.

To search the items, you can type in the searchbox; as you type, non-matching items will be removed from the list.

This project uses knockout.js, as well as Google Maps, FourSquare and Flickr APIs.
